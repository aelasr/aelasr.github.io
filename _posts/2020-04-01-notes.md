- If people were homes I would have been a small wooden home, refusing what they call evolution and see it a warmth murderer

- You will be a beautiful mother, simplifying stories, making ponytails and singing and dancing in evenings. Cooking with her daughter toys and delivering her Barbie food with a kiss and a hug.

- You canâ€™t be nothing but stubborn against someone who is known for being stubborn, and maybe both of you are being stubborn towards each other just because you both see each other this way, nothing more nothing less!

- Whenever I read a story someone saying about their lover, hear it, or pass by me in anyway, I find you in it. You are in all love stories!

- Your sadness is as beautiful as a saxophone, I love you!

- A man being attracted by food is the first man to fall!

- Sky is sad when you are not here

- You are as beautiful as morning laziness!

- When I saw you for the first time, every bad thing in this life disappeared from all around me or I stopped noticing them!

- Every day I look at the sky waiting for it to rain you over me
