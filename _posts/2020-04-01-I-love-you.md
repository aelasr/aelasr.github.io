Hello, I love you!

I want to kiss your eyes in your sleep one day, I want to hold your hands and I want to lie next to you. Follow your breath, and maybe, if you let me, put your head under my shoulder and let you hear my heartbeats. I will hug you for long hours before speaking one word, I will dive so deep in you until I lose all senses of me and the world around me and lose my feeling of the time passing by.

I want to lose myself to find you, then lose my mind and my logic by finding you! By only a touch from you. I love you, I loved you and I will love you for the rest of my life!
