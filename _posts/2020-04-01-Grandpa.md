His body is a bag he traveled with and took pictures of it, people put things in it so his heart got lighter at times and heavier at others.

His face is a memory and a story written in his wrinkles. I touched them with my hand, and I was a kid.

“Your face is a lot grandpa!” I said,

He replies: “This is called wrinkles, whenever my world bent on me, it kissed me near my eyes, so my skin gets wrinkles after I smile. And sometimes my world bent on me and made me cry and my skin soaked up the salt of my tears until it dropped and with water and time and salt tear drops my skin got vintage”

When he smiled at me, a story sparkled on his forehead, patiently telling me every time where did he get his stories from, where did he get all his charm from! And it told a lifetime and faces and an old love story and songs.

When he met a bird or a cat, they become friends. And if a neighbor’s dog slept under his car, he postpones his drive.

I never told him before that endings don’t suit him, or that they don’t suit his salty face like the sea, they don’t suit his stories, nor that peace inside of him.
