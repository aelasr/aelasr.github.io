Happy Birthday!

I keep talking about how much your birthday means to me but you will never know how much that day and every day since I met you means to me!  


I love you today more than yesterday and I'll love you more tomorrow. I know that being apart from you is suicide to me and living without you is impossible. And I know that I will never stop loving you not even for one day and I will never get bored of waiting for you.  
I will stay as I am, every part of me is attached to you. Resting in a beautiful book that I will give you as a gift one day.  
I will stay as I am, a plant that that refuses to follow all of the rules of the field, waiting to lie in your head to grow up and flourish!  


And you will always stay my little baby, whom I feel so happy when she gifts me a smile, and whom I fly from happiness whenever she hugs my arm with her little ones. Whom I will always pull to my heart to show her how much I love her and how much I miss her even when she is there.  


I will always get my oxygen from your breathing to live, and strength from you to walk through and my courage to face the impossible.  
I will always be a cloud showering only you with rain of adoration then falling down from the sky to hang over you and protect you!  
I will always be crazy in love with you, never accepting anything but having you mine and being proud to be yours.  


You will always be my star, my moon, my hamster and my butterfly that I will never stop following her heartbeats in life, in my dreams and my reality.  
You will always be my greatest dream that will never end and my happiness that will never stop sparkling in my heart as long as you are with me.  
You will always be everything, the most important and the most precious.  
You will always be mine, my life, my soul and my only dream!  


I will write your name on trees and flowers and walls and our kids hands to let the whole universe knows that you are my first and last love.

And my oath in my heart can't be even put into words.

I just love you with my heart and soul and every sense of me!
