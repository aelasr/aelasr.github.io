title: The Fisherman and the Mermaid
---

A fisherman was sailing his wooden boat through a sea of demons and darkeness.

Under the boat beneath layers of waves and thick water where light is out of reach, a mermade lived.

The fisherman fought against the darkness and demons.

Rayes of light spreaded from his heart.

The mermade ashonishingly followed the light, and they met each other on the top of the fisherman's wooden boat.

Her heart shines like a sun, a magic island appeared in the far horizon.

Towards the island the mermaid and fisherman sailed together, leaving behind them shiny sparkling diamonds floating on the surface of the water, made of their memories.
