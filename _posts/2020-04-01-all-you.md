A man standing on stage to sing. Behind him a musician hugging his guitar as if it’s another organ in his body. The deep whispers of the singer. What happens to your heart when the second plays the guitar strings.

An attractive black, worn by a man and a woman on their way to a night out near a bridge and everywhere is empty except from their table by the sea and that moon light filling your eyes with cold and warmth!

First song for kids in kindergarten. First night for a teenager alone outside home. Last perfume drops in a perfume bottle saved in a cupboard for long time.

Singing, homemade cookies, birds in the sky, evenings, the sea and the beach, dried up flowers hanging on the wall, artists’ beautiful mess, the chills of the first meeting, stories of old people, toys and clothes of babies, the strict side of my mom’s advises, the goofy side of her jokes, and the smell of my shirt.

They all remind me of you, and they’re all you.
