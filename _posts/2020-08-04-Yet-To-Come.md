title: The Most Beautiful Is Yet To Come
---

We didn't go to the most beautiful seas yet!  
The birth of the most beautiful child didn't happen yet!  
We didn't live our most beautiful days yet!*  
And even the most beautiful word I would say.. A word I didn't say to your eyes yet!  

*And every next day will be always the most beautiful, so until death we will always have a more beautiful yet to come.
