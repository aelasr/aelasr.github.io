And because now she start to love herself, and I see no problem in loving herself!
Because now she eats, reads, studies, laughs, dances and breathes
She needs to walk streets and alleys she never seen before
She wants to travel to an empty land nobody is in, vast empty lands
She needs to ponder the universe more, screams loudly and nobody hears her

She also wishes to travel to a place where nobody knows her
She doesn't need 

She may want someone understands her well, who can read her from her smile and understand her from her eyes.
She wants him to come suddenly with no previous date or agreement, behind her back, covers her eyes and asks her about what else from her dreams are left to be achieved!
