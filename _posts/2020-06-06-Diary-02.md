What’s your color?

It’s not a color on its own. It’s a brunette starting to float in awakening after sinking in sleep. She starts to hardly open her eyes towards a loud beach in front of her. What reaches her sight from it is nothing but a rectangle under her big hat. With the rectangle’s endings are fading, and the sea colors in the middle are sharp. And no sounds around her reach her ears except weak far sounds, as if she’s hearing them under water.

You’re the color of that chilling trance moment between wake and sleep, so what do you call that color?
