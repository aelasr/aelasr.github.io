-For a day ending today and history called it 17th of every months

>I have never smiled every time I mentioned or thought of someone, even when I remember a misunderstanding or argument between us, that's a first for me and for the idea itself, I assume nobody smiles while remembering and argument except her and I. I asked her once and my head kept moving round and round. How was I before I met you?

Nobody understands the face of the lonely traveler standing next to the train door. Isolated, doesn't stay in a cabinet, as if he is afraid of belonging even to a train, when he leans on the glass staring at pictures running fast in front of his eyes, and he's in his place rigid and silent, standing still to the end until he got bored of it and decided to travel and search without any desire to find anything. That was a traveler inside of me I called it myself, he reminds of the face of someone who just woke up or maybe struggling to not fall asleep so he kept his eyes wide open looking at a spot he got distracted by and forgot about whatever happening around him.

That traveler was a strong perfume not mixed with any water or alcohol, it chokes you once you touch it or get close to it, and he lived in a small town so the smallest news in it became a big even for him, his reasoning ended and his mark faded and his sweetness disappeared, people describe him as a traveler even if he's with them in the same home, his 

He knew something was wrong when he woke up one day to realize that most things don't interest him anymore, however he stayed a traveler even though he was always surrounded by people he cares for and they care for him. He was a man seen to be in need for a babysitter because he calls his mom at night and doesn't feel shy about that.

I don't miss that traveler in anyway, and I don't miss those who were raising him in me, and I feel happy every time I notice that I barely remember that history and that it has no mark on my shirt.

Thank you, for my new self, for making me a good friend of it, and for the peace that came between us finally.
Grateful, smiling and happy.

Friday, 17th of January.
