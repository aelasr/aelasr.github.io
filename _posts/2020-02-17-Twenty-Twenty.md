And because now she started to love herself, and I see no problem in loving herself!

Because now she eats, reads, studies, laughs, dances and breathes

She needs to walk streets and alleys she never seen before

She wants to travel to an empty land nobody is in, vast empty lands

She needs to ponder the universe more, screams loudly and nobody hears her

She also wishes to travel the world and go to to places where nobody knows her

She doesn't need complicated people or things anymore, people and things that push her into a dark cave where sun can't reach even for one minute a day

She may want someone who discovers her inside well, who can read her from her smile and understand her from her eyes.

She wants him to come suddenly with no previous date or agreement, behind her back, covers her eyes and asks her about what else from her dreams are left to be achieved!
