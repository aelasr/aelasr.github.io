I can't stand toughness or aggressiveness, and I can't deal with anyone being this way with any amount of it even if the rest of people can handle it in him or her.

I notice that I get cold and dry out when someone gets tough with me, and a strange energy grows in me out of nowhere, it makes me stay with the same opinion and the same feeling and never change any of both no matter what. And I don't feel sympathy with anyone being loud and tough, even if they weren't this way with me and even if it wasn
t for me!


Iâ€™m like a plant stem, I lean with a soft wind.
