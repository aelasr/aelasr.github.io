Like a father being happy with his first baby daughter’s name carrying his last name. Like he starts smelling her forehead and plays with the little hair on the of the middle of her head, he kisses her tiny hand that can only hold one of his fingers and can’t hold the rest. Like he bends with his ear to hear her breathing, tickles him, while looking down at her legs moving.

"A baby girl?" and like the excitement of the answer to this question; please be my first daughter, nobody will ever take this place after you. Don’t be only my lover, a mother nor a friend. I want you to be my daughter before anyone of my children, my first daughter and my first mark, first one to carry my name forever, my first tenderness, my first life in my life, my first fatherhood and my first experience, my first way to get back to my childhood and its pureness, my first mistake with a baby that I’ll apologize to and hold tight, my first happily staying up late until she sleeps, my first!
