title: Bad Friend's Scolding 
---

That heart, kill it, can't you see? It walks on two feet, it has a tongue and these freaky eyes, what's wrong with them? Tell me, where did we then feel its modesty, with all this noises of it? And tell me slowly, how can't that be scary?

When you threw it there, we watched it. In its calmess there was a movement. And in its silence there were talks. It scares us with one look. It orders us, moves us, and scares us. It looks down at us and resents us, as if we are not a fit to where it stands high!

Don't you know what it said? "You're weak, without a shield or a cover."
If you became its enemy; you lose, if you became its friend; you lose, and if you didn't become this or that; you lose. In every war you lose and you refuse to admit that its power over you reached the peak.

It betrayed you and revealed your secrets;
So kill it.
