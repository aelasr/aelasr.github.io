Today I looked at myself in the mirror, it felt as if I see myself for the first time. In them was a dream travelled all over my body and settled in my eyes to announce its existence.

Another dream that again I considered the first and last, My goal and target that once I found them in me I held onto them so tight because of how long I've been waiting to find them.

I know that in my way I'll fall many times, And my vision of everything will change many times, but on the other hand I know that all I need when this happens is someone who holds me and be patient with me and with all foolish words I say, someone who supports what falls until it stands up again. And I don't think anyone else but you can do this! So keep on succeeding and following your own dreams and being happy, because in your success I succeed and in your fall down I fall down.

This is my way of saying happy vacation.
Be happy for me!
